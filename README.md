### Identifying Requirements for Healthcare Appointment Management System

#### Problem:
Hospitals and clinics often have unoptimized scheduling, leaving patients waiting unnecessarily. The system will prioritize appointments based on urgency and availability and predict minor diseases from symptoms.

---

#### Objectives:

* Identify ambiguities, inconsistencies, and incompleteness in the requirements.
* Define functional and non-functional requirements.

---

#### Theory: Requirements

**Sommerville** defines "requirement" as what the system should do, not how. Requirements engineering involves understanding customer expectations and documenting them clearly to guide design, implementation, and verification.

---

#### Characteristics of Requirements:

1. **Unambiguity**: Clear system behavior, e.g., defining "urgent" appointments.
2. **Consistency**: No conflicting requirements, e.g., emergency prioritization must align with scheduling.
3. **Completeness**: Requirements should also define what the system should not do, e.g., preventing invalid bookings.

---

#### Categorization of Requirements:

1. **User Requirements**: Simple language for customer verification.
2. **System Requirements**: Technical details for development and testing teams.

---

#### Functional vs. Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Functional Requirements (FRs)**:

   * Book, reschedule, or cancel appointments.
   * Predict diseases based on symptoms.

2. **Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)**:

   * Handle 1000 concurrent users without performance issues.
   * Prioritize emergency appointments.

---

#### Functional Requirements for Healthcare Appointment System:

1. **Appointment Booking**: Patients can book, reschedule, or cancel appointments.
2. **Waitlist Management**: Prioritize urgent patients for available slots.
3. **Disease Prediction**: Predict minor diseases from symptoms.
4. **Emergency Prioritization**: Urgent cases prioritized in scheduling.
5. **Doctor Schedule Management**: Doctors manage availability and appointments.

---

#### Non-Functional Requirements:

1. **Performance**: Quick processing of bookings and predictions.
2. **Security**: Encrypt patient data and manage access control.
3. **Usability**: User-friendly interfaces.
4. **Availability**: 24/7 system uptime.
5. **Scalability**: System can scale with more patients and doctors.

---

#### Software Requirements Specification (SRS):

The **SRS** document consolidates functional and non-functional requirements. It serves as a reference to ensure the system aligns with customer expectations and provides a framework for verification.

---

#### Key Elements of the SRS:

1. **Introduction**: Overview and stakeholders (patients, doctors, admins).
2. **System Features**: Appointment booking, waitlist management, disease prediction.
3. **External Interface Requirements**: Interfaces for users and APIs.
4. **System Attributes**: Performance, security, usability.
5. **Appendices**: Diagrams (UML, E-R Models, etc.).

---

#### Conclusion:

Identifying clear, consistent, and complete requirements is essential for the design and successful implementation of the Healthcare Appointment Management System. These requirements guide the development process and ensure the system meets user needs.
