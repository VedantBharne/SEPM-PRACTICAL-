#### Healthcare Appointment Management System with Waitlist and Disease Prediction

⸻

## 1. Introduction
	•	Purpose
To design a system that improves appointment scheduling in hospitals and clinics by reducing patient wait times and incorporating disease prediction.
	•	Scope
The system allows patients to book, reschedule, or cancel appointments, manage waitlists based on urgency, and predict minor diseases based on symptoms.
	•	Overview
Includes features such as appointment booking, waitlist management, doctor availability tracking, disease prediction using AI, and emergency prioritization.

## 2. General Description
	•	Functions
Book appointments, reschedule/cancel, predict diseases, manage waitlists, and prioritize emergencies.
	•	User Community
Patients, doctors, and administrative staff in hospitals and clinics.

⸻

## 3. Functional Requirements
	•	Possible Outcomes
Appointment confirmed, waitlisted, rescheduled, canceled.
	•	Ranked Order
